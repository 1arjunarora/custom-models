# Boston Housing Example

This folder includes an example of how to use DRUM with different custom models.

You can use google colab to follow alone with `Main_Script.ipynb`.

In this notebook you will 

* build a random forest using sklearn
* use DRUM to score data in batch
* use DRUM to test if the model can handel missing values
* use DRUM to serve the model as a rest enpoint
* show how easy it is to swap out models (also built on boston data)
* lastly, with a [datarobot trial](https://www.datarobot.com/trial/) account, register and monitor the model
